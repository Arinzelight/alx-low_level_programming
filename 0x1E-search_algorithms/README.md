# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

## Learning Objectives


### General

- **What is a search algorithm?**
  A search algorithm is a step-by-step process used to locate specific data among a collection of data. It involves systematically examining each element in a dataset to determine whether the desired item is present.

- **What is a linear search?**
  A linear search is a simple search algorithm that iteratively checks each element in a list or array until the target element is found or the entire list has been searched. It has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the dataset.

- **What is a binary search?**
  Binary search is a more efficient search algorithm, particularly for sorted datasets. It works by repeatedly dividing the search range in half until the target element is found or the search range becomes empty. It has a time complexity of O(log n), making it faster than linear search for large datasets.

- **What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs?**
  The choice of the best search algorithm depends on various factors, including the size and order of the dataset. Linear search is suitable for small unsorted datasets, while binary search excels in large sorted datasets. Other factors, such as the frequency of searches and the need for real-time results, also influence the choice of the search algorithm
